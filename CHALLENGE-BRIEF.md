# [SDF01] Challenge: My First Repo 🚀  

Welcome to your **first GitHub challenge**! This is your chance to explore **version control**, set up your own **repository**, and personalize it as your **first step** toward building real-world projects.

## ✅ **Your Mission**  
Your task is to **take ownership of this repo**, make it your own, and submit it for review. Along the way, you’ll:  
- **Set up** your repository so it belongs to you.  
- **Customize** your README to reflect who you are as a developer.  
- **Commit and push** your changes to ensure they are saved and visible.

## 🚨 **Submission Instructions**  
Make sure your project **follows the correct naming format**, is publicly available, and is submitted through the LMS. Your README should be **personalized** and **cleaned up** to reflect your work.

## 🎯 **What Success Looks Like**  
- Your repository **exists under your GitHub account** and contains your updates.  
- The README file **introduces you properly** and is free of placeholders.  
- The **original challenge title is removed** and replaced with something that reflects your personal project.  
- You have **committed and pushed** at least one update.
